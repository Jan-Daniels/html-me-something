		<h1>The Beginning</h1>
		<p>Most of my life I have lived in St. Louis, MO.  My childhood existed of getting good grades, playing sports, and spending time with family and friends. I actually wanted to be a professional softball player but I did take my parents advice and made a backup plan.</p>

		<h1>High School</h1>
		<p>When I reached high school, my strengths really started to show. My love for math, sports, and photography. I loved school so much, I achieved perfect attendance for high school. I played softball, basketball, and track.  Sports brought out the curiousity in me and when I made the track team, I knew how to run, but I wanted to dabble in learning how to throw the discus and shot put. Since I was physically challenged (I wasn't that tall or big), and to stay competitive, I included weight training and learned all about the spin for throwing the discus. I went to the State Champsionship and finished 2nd in discus. I was hoping to get a college scholarship with being in the honor society throughout my high school years and with my sports achievements, but scholarships were hard to come by for females. So, I chose to attend Springfield, MO for college and hopefully be a walk-on for softball.</p>

		<h1>First Year of College</h1>
		<p>My first year in college was quite a transition for me. It was 4 hours away from home and met with many challenges but I wanted to experience life on my own. The one reason I chose SMSU (Southwest Missouri State University) was because of it's Computer Science program. That curiousity I had for sports was now coming into play with my education career. After my first college year was over, I made a tough decision to stay home.  A few big reasons were my uncle had a job where I could make my own hours and still attend college and I missed my mom's home cooking. Plus, I had a car to drive.</p>

		<h1>Softball</h1>
		<p>My softball career took off when I came home from Springfiled, MO. I tried out for a select softball team, the Manchaester Reds. Even though I didn't start in the first game of our first tournament, when my coach finally put me in the game, my first time at bat, I hit a grand slam. I played for the Manchester Reds several years and my dream of becoming professional was close disminished but the professional softball league closed. I thought my dream was over but the pro softball players still wanted to play. So, the pros were placed on several of the select teams and that's how my dream came true and it was awesome.</p>

		<h1>Completing College</h1>
		<p>Since I was paying my own way through college, I attended St. Louis Community College, and earned my associate in Data Processing. I went on to attend Fontbonne College. I was accepted into their co-op program which meant, for three semesters, I worked for Boeing during the day and took classes at night. My original chosen degree was to earn a Computer Science degree. But my counselor and then Mathematics Department chairperson had a discussion with me during my junior year. She wasn't going to let me graduate because she felt the daytime teachers were much better. I was devasted. Again my dreams were crushed but with the help of my economic's professor, I was able to graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration with a concentration on Computer Programming. </p>

		<h1>Starting My Business Career</h1>
		<p>After graduating from college, I worked for Siemens PLM Software. I loved it. My curiousity that developed through my education career and sports career, exploded in my business career. I wanted to learn everything about the release cycle, so I learned how to install, code, test, and document which eventually helped to create my own position as the release manager. Becoming a release manager speaks volumes about my skills and my strengths because you need to be organized, you need to pay attention to details, you need to be able to communicate at all levels of management and be able to create a team environment so your team members know you value them and their quality of work they provide. One of my accomplishments for this company was creating a web page to summarize customer problems which in turn reduced costs, increased productivity, and increased communication at all levels. But life had other plans for me and my career had to take a detour after I was laid off.</p>

		<h1>Starting My Education Career</h1>
		<p>It was hard to find employment in the software development since most of the companies were laying off. So, I decided to take a leap and go back to school to create a new career path. I attended Lindenwood University and earned my masters in Secondary Education. My career started at a local high school, teaching mathematics, and later I ventured out to teaching mathematics, business management, and computer classes at local colleges. But my LOVE and PASSION has always been with software development. When LaunchCode offered their "Summer of Code" classes, I jumped at the chance to enroll, hoping this will help open doors for me to get back into the software development.</p>

		<h1>My Favorite Photos</h1>
		<p>Photography is one of my favorite hobbies. One of my favorite vacations was taking my kids to Europe. Of course I took a bunch of photos and here's just a few I would like to share:</p>
